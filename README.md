# ethereum-wallet-transaction-fetcher
This Python script fetches all transaction relationships of an Ethereum wallet from the Etherscan API and recursively fetches transactions for the connected wallets. It outputs the relationships and transaction amounts in ETH to the console and saves the data in a `transactions.json` file.
